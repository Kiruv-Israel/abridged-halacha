# Murder Laws Guide
Murder is one of the most severe transgressions in Jewish law. The Torah explicitly states, "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17). This section seeks to elucidate the halachic implications and guidelines concerning this grave sin.

#### The Act of Murder

1. **Definition**: Murder is the intentional killing of a human being (Sanhedrin 74a).

2. **Non-Human Killing**: Killing a non-human creature is not classified as murder, though it may violate other commandments (Bava Metzia 32b).

#### Categories of Killers

1. **Mezid**: Intentional murder is punishable by death if witnessed and warned by two adult, Jewish male witnesses (Sanhedrin 57a, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 2:1).

2. **Shogeg**: Unintentional killing is not subject to the death penalty but requires exile to a city of refuge (Numbers 35:22-28, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 6:1-4).

3. **Tinok Shenishba**: A child captured among non-Jews who commits murder unknowingly is judged based on specific circumstances (Sanhedrin 72b, Shulchan Aruch CM 425:1).

#### Witness and Warning

1. **Two Witnesses**: The act must be witnessed by at least two adult, Jewish males (Deuteronomy 17:6, Sanhedrin 30a).

2. **Warning**: Witnesses must provide a clear warning to the would-be murderer just before the act (Rambam Hilchot Sanhedrin 12:2).

#### Punishment

1. **Death Penalty**: The punishment for intentional murder is death by decapitation if all conditions are met (Sanhedrin 9:1, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 2:1).

2. **Exile**: In the case of accidental murder, the perpetrator is exiled to a city of refuge (Numbers 35:25, Shulchan Aruch CM 425:1).

#### Mitigating Factors

1. **Self-Defense**: Killing in self-defense is permitted (Sanhedrin 72a, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 1:7).

2. **Duress**: A person forced to kill under threat of death is generally exempt from the death penalty (Rambam Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah 5:5).

#### Legal Procedures

1. **Court Composition**: Cases of murder are tried by a Sanhedrin of 23 judges (Sanhedrin 1:4, Rambam Hilchot Sanhedrin 5:1).

2. **Cross-Examination**: Witnesses are subject to rigorous cross-examination to ensure consistency (Sanhedrin 40a, Rambam Hilchot Edut 1:1).

3. **Majority Rule**: A simple majority is sufficient for acquittal, but a majority of two is required for conviction (Sanhedrin 2:1, Rambam Hilchot Sanhedrin 9:1).

4. **No Self-Incrimination**: The accused is not required to testify against himself (Rambam Hilchot Sanhedrin 18:6, Shulchan Aruch CM 73:1).

#### Forbidden Types of Killing

1. **Abortion**: The termination of a pregnancy is generally not permitted, except for specific circumstances to save the mother's life (Ohalot 7:6, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 1:9).

2. **Euthanasia**: Assisting in the death of a terminally ill person is forbidden (Avodah Zarah 18a, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 2:7).

3. **Animal Attacks**: One must properly confine a dangerous animal to prevent it from killing (Bava Kamma 46a, Shulchan Aruch CM 409:3).

#### Accessories to Murder

1. **Instigators**: One who incites another to commit murder shares the guilt (Sanhedrin 37b, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 2:2).

2. **Accomplices**: Those who aid and abet a murderer are also liable (Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 1:13).

#### Teshuva (Repentance)

1. **Expiation**: While human courts may impose earthly penalties, Teshuva is the only avenue for divine atonement (Rambam Hilchot Teshuva 1:1).

2. **Remorse and Confession**: Genuine remorse and confession to HaShem are vital steps in Teshuva (Rambam Hilchot Teshuva 2:2).

#### Special Cases and Considerations

1. **Soldier in Battle**: A soldier killing in a sanctioned war does not incur the death penalty (Sotah 44b, Rambam Hilchot Melachim 6:4).

2. **Minors**: Individuals under the age of 13 for boys and 12 for girls are generally exempt from penalties but are educated to repent (Sanhedrin 72a, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 2:12).

3. **Insanity**: Individuals who are mentally incompetent are exempt from legal penalties (Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 4:8).

4. **Non-Jews**: The seven Noahide laws, which include the prohibition against murder, apply to non-Jews, and they are liable for breaking this law (Sanhedrin 56b, Rambam Hilchot Melachim 9:1).

#### Social and Ethical Implications

1. **Value of Life**: The sanctity of life is of paramount importance in Judaism. "Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5).

2. **Prevention**: It is everyone's duty to take preventive measures to protect life (Leviticus 19:16, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 11:4).

3. **Blood Money**: In some cases, financial restitution may be demanded by the victim's family, but it cannot replace the formal penalties (Shulchan Aruch CM 421:1).

#### Additional Legal Nuances

1. **Non-Lethal Harm**: Causing non-lethal harm to another person is also a grave offense and subject to various laws and penalties (Bava Kamma 83a, Rambam Hilchot Chovel u'Mazik 1:1).

2. **Endangerment**: Recklessly endangering another's life, even without causing actual harm, is a serious offense (Shabbat 32a, Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 12:14).

3. **Capital Cases**: In capital cases involving murder, the court is obligated to find any possible leniency to acquit the accused (Makkot 7a, Shulchan Aruch CM 388:2).

4. **Post-Mortem**: According to Jewish law, there are specific guidelines on how to handle a body post-mortem to respect the sanctity of life (Moed Katan 24a, Rambam Hilchot Avel 14:21).

#### Halachic Development

1. **Rabbinical Enactments**: Over time, the sages have enacted various decrees to fence around the laws of murder, to prevent possible transgressions (Pirkei Avot 1:1).

2. **Contemporary Issues**: With the advancement of technology, new questions arise, such as the permissibility of pulling the plug on life support, and must be addressed by contemporary Halachic authorities (Iggrot Moshe, Choshen Mishpat II, 73).

### Conclusion

This concludes the initial, unrevised draft of the abridged set of Jewish laws focusing specifically on the laws of murder. The aim is for this document to be as comprehensive as possible while remaining accessible to both the layperson and the scholar.
