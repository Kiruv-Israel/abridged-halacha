# Intimacy Laws Guide
An abridged set of Jewish laws in English focusing only on laws of Intimacy. This code aims to be as comprehensive as the Shulchan Aruch and is intended to be easily understood and implemented by both the general Jewish population and the courts. 

# Chapter 1: The Sanctity of Intimacy

## Law 1: The Obligation to Marry

Every Jewish man is obligated to marry and have children, as the Torah commands, "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28). The aim is to fulfill the Divine Will and to bring sanctity into the most intimate aspects of human life.
