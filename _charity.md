# Charity Laws
For the sake of clarity and conciseness, this draft will be an abridged version focusing solely on the Laws of Charity (Tzedakah).

### Section 1: Obligation to Give Charity (Tzedakah)

**1.1 Basic Obligation**
Every Jew is obligated to give tzedakah to the extent that he or she is able (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 7:5).

**1.2 Giving to the Needy**
Charity must be given to those who are truly in need, regardless of whether they are related to the donor (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 251:3).

**1.3 Prioritizing Relatives**
One should prioritize relatives over strangers when giving charity, as long as the relatives are in genuine need (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 8:18).

### Section 2: Amount to Be Given

**2.1 Basic Amount**
The ideal amount for tzedakah is to give one-tenth (a "tithe") of one's income (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 249:1).

**2.2 Upper Limit**
The upper limit for giving charity should not exceed one-fifth of one's income, except in exceptional circumstances (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 7:5).

### Section 3: How to Give

**3.1 Giving in Secret**
The highest level of giving tzedakah is to do so anonymously (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:7-14).

**3.2 Prioritizing Local Needs**
One should prioritize local charitable needs over those that are distant (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 251:3).

### Section 4: To Whom to Give

**4.1 Poor over Rich**
Charity should be prioritized to the poor rather than the rich (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 251:9).

**4.2 Non-Jews**
While the primary obligation is to Jewish recipients, it is also a mitzvah to give charity to non-Jews in certain circumstances, for the sake of peaceful coexistence (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 7:7).

### Section 5: The Attitude of the Giver

**5.1 Giving Willingly**
Charity should be given willingly and with a cheerful heart (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:4).

The giver should demonstrate compassion rather than pity. The recipient should not feel demeaned by the act of receiving (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 249:3).

### Section 6: Timing and Frequency

**6.1 Regular Giving**
It is better to give smaller amounts of charity frequently than to give a large sum all at once (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 9:3).

**6.2 Special Times**
Certain times are particularly auspicious for giving charity, such as before Shabbat and holidays (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 694:3).

The community is obligated to establish a charity fund, overseen by trustworthy individuals (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 9:1).

Every member of the community must contribute to this fund according to his means (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 256:1).

### Section 8: Legal Aspects in Courts

**8.1 Enforcement**
If someone refuses to give the proper amount of charity, the beit din (rabbinical court) has the authority to compel him to give (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 7:10).

**8.2 Disputes**
Disputes concerning charitable giving should be settled by the beit din (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 163:3).

### Section 9: Exceptional Circumstances

**9.1 Financial Hardship**
In times of financial hardship, one is exempt from giving tzedakah beyond his means but should still give a minimal amount to uphold the commandment (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 7:5).

**9.2 Cases of Extreme Need**
In dire situations where life is at risk, all limitations on charitable giving may be temporarily waived (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 251:4).

### Section 10: Allocation of Funds

**10.1 Different Types of Charitable Causes**
While the primary aim is to provide for the basic needs of the poor, funds can also be allocated for other types of charitable causes like Torah study, redeeming captives, etc. (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 8:15).

**10.2 Evaluating the Cause**
The effectiveness and need of a charitable cause should be carefully considered when deciding how to allocate funds (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 259:1).

### Section 11: Additional Laws and Customs

**11.1 Women and Charity**
Women are also obligated in the mitzvah of tzedakah, and their unique insights into who is deserving can often be invaluable (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:16).

**11.2 The Power of Small Contributions**
Never underestimate the impact of even the smallest charitable act, for each contributes to a greater whole (Mishnah, Pirkei Avot 2:1).

### Section 12: Charitable Acts Beyond Money

Failing to give tzedakah is considered a grave offense, and one distances himself from Divine blessings (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 247:2).

**13.2 Social Consequence**
The health of a community is, in part, gauged by its commitment to charity. Neglecting this duty can erode the communal fabric (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 9:3).

### Section 14: Laws for the Recipient

A person who is in true need should not feel ashamed to accept charity (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 255:2).

The tithe for charity (Maaser) is deeply rooted in the spiritual architecture of the universe and should be observed meticulously (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 7:5).

**16.1 Charity Boxes in Synagogue**
It is customary to place charity boxes in synagogues to encourage regular giving among congregants (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 694:1).

The highest form of charity is when neither the giver nor the recipient knows the identity of the other (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:8).

**16.3 Special Care in Holiday Seasons**
Increased giving is encouraged around Jewish holidays, and special funds are often organized to enable the needy to celebrate properly (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 429:1).

### Section 17: Reciprocity and Mutual Responsibility

**17.1 A Two-Way Street**
The giver benefits spiritually from the act of charity, making tzedakah a symbiotic relationship rather than a one-way act of giving (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:1).

**17.2 The Eternal Reward**
Charitable acts are considered as investments for the World to Come, and the rewards are everlasting (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 247:3).

### Section 18: Contemporary Issues

In our digital age, online or electronic giving is permissible as long as it is secure and reaches the intended recipient (based on principles from Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 259:1).

**18.2 Tax Implications**
While tax deductions should not be the primary motive, they are a permissible benefit of charitable giving (based on principles from Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:1).

### Section 19: Charity in Times of Crisis

In times of crisis, priority should generally be given to local needs unless the overseas need is more pressing (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 251:3).

**20.1 The Divine Partnership**
Through tzedakah, we become partners with HaShem in sustaining the world (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:1).

The community as a whole has an obligation to set up organized forms of charity, including funds and other programs (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 256:1).

Community-run charitable organizations must maintain transparency and adhere to ethical standards, avoiding any form of misappropriation (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 9:12).

### Section 22: Special Cases and Exceptions

**22.1 Loans over Charity**
Sometimes, providing an interest-free loan is more beneficial than giving charity, as it can enable the person to become self-sufficient (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 10:7).

**22.2 The Wandering Beggar**
Special considerations should be made for travelers or wandering beggars who may have immediate needs (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 250:4).

### Section 23: Future Implications

**23.1 Adapting to New Circumstances**
As society evolves, Halakhic authorities may need to address new scenarios and questions that arise, always grounding their responses in the foundational texts and principles (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 1:1).

The work presented here serves as a mere introduction to the intricate laws and profound lessons encapsulated in the realm of tzedakah. The intention has been to offer a comprehensive yet accessible guide, grounded in the eternal wisdom of our tradition.

**23.2 Eternal Relevance**
The laws and principles of tzedakah, while deeply rooted in our ancient texts, possess an eternal relevance. They are not static but continually engage with the realities of our lives (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 1:2).

**23.3 A Living Tradition**
The interpretation and application of these laws are a living tradition, shaped and reshaped by the great scholars of each generation, always within the framework of Halakhic continuity (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Mamrim 1:1).

This literary endeavor is not a final word but an opening dialogue, inviting every Jew to engage deeply with the laws of tzedakah. May this guide be a helpful tool for all those who seek to fulfill this great mitzvah, as we strive collectively to embody the virtues of justice and kindness that HaShem cherishes.
