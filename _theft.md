# Theft Laws
An abridged set of Jewish laws in English focusing only on laws of Theft. This code aims to be as comprehensive as the Shulchan Aruch and is intended to be easily understood and implemented by both the general Jewish population and the courts. 

### Chapter 1: Basic Principles of Theft

#### Section 1: Definition of Theft

1. **Theft Defined**: Theft in Jewish law, or *G'neivah*, refers to the unlawful taking of another's property without their knowledge or consent. The act violates the commandment, "Lo Tignov" (Exodus 20:15, Leviticus 19:11).

#### Section 2: Intent

1. **Intent Required**: For an act to be considered theft, there must be an intent to permanently deprive the owner of their property (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Gezeilah ve-Geneivah 1:3).

#### Section 3: Categories of Thieves

1. **Daylight Thief (*Ganav*)**: One who steals in a concealed manner. The Torah stipulates double repayment for such a thief (Exodus 22:3).
  
2. **Robber (*Gazlan*)**: One who steals openly, in the presence of others. Required to return the stolen item or its value (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Gezeilah ve-Geneivah 1:3).

#### Section 4: Subjects of Theft

1. **Animals and Goods**: Theft of animals and inanimate objects are included (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Gezeilah ve-Geneivah, Chapter 1).

2. **Intangible Property**: Intellectual property and stealing time are areas of halachic discussion, but traditional theft laws may not apply directly (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 359).

### Chapter 2: Restitution and Penalties

#### Section 1: Restitution Amounts

1. **Double Repayment (*Kefel*)**: A concealed thief (*Ganav*) is obligated to pay double the amount of what was stolen if the stolen object is no longer in its original state (Exodus 22:3, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Gezeilah ve-Geneivah 1:2).

2. **Four and Fivefold**: For stolen sheep and cattle that were either slaughtered or sold, the thief must pay fourfold or fivefold, respectively (Exodus 22:1).

#### Section 2: Returning the Object

1. **Return or Equal Value**: The robber (*Gazlan*) is required to return the stolen object itself or its monetary value (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Gezeilah ve-Geneivah 1:3).

#### Section 3: Situations Where Double Repayment is Not Applicable

1. **Immediate Repentance**: If the thief confesses and returns the stolen object before being summoned by a Beit Din (Jewish court), he is exempt from double repayment (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Gezeilah ve-Geneivah 1:4).

2. **Robbery**: Double repayment is not applicable to robbers (*Gazlanim*), who must only return the stolen object or its value (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Gezeilah ve-Geneivah 1:3).

#### Section 4: Procedure in Beit Din

1. **Two Witnesses Required**: To establish guilt, two kosher witnesses must testify against the thief (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Edut 5:1).
