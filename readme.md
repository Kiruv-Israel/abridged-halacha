# Abridged Halacha

## An Abridged Set of Jewish Laws in English

### Introduction

Creating an abridged set of Jewish laws in English is not just a scholarly endeavor but a sacred task that demands the utmost respect for the halachic process. This project aims to make Jewish law more accessible to the general population and the courts, without compromising the depth and intricacy that Halacha embodies. 

### The Mission

As discussed by Rabbi Yonatan HaLevy, the mission is to draft an initial, unrevised version of a new, abridged set of Jewish laws. This code aims to be as comprehensive as the Shulchan Aruch, one of the most authoritative codifications of Jewish law. The goal is to make these laws easily understandable and implementable by both the general Jewish population and the courts. The project will always cite authoritative Halachic sources such as the Torah, Mishnah, Mishneh Torah by the Rambam, and the Shulchan Aruch by Rabbi Yosef Karo. 

### Importance of Citing Sources

The integrity of this project hinges on the meticulous citation of sources. Jewish law is a complex and multi-faceted discipline that has been developed and refined over millennia. As such, every law or ruling included in this project will be accompanied by references to the original texts from which they are derived. This could include the Torah, Talmud, and other Halachic works, specifying the 'author, sefer, chapter, tractate, section, page, verse', as is customary.

### Call for Contributors

We invite scholars, students of Jewish law, and anyone interested in contributing to this monumental task to collaborate with us. Your contributions will not only enrich this project but also serve the broader Jewish community by making the laws more accessible.

### Disclaimer

While we will endeavor to adhere to the sources and maintain the highest level of accuracy, it's imperative to consult qualified rabbinic authorities for a complete understanding and practical implementation of Jewish law.
